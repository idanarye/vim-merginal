## Unreleased
### Added
- `g:merginal_showCommands` to control whether Git commands will be `echo`ed.
- `g:merginal_resizeWindowToBranchLen` and `g:merginal_resizePadding` to resize the branch list to fit the branches lengths.
- `ms` keymap for merging with `--squash`.
- `g:merginal_branchListFlags` to control the branch list displayed in the Merginal buffer.

### Fixed
- Use `Git` instead of `Gstatus` (which was deprecated and removed from Fugitive)

## [2.2.4] - 2023-08-27
### Fixed
- `ds` now calls `:Ghdiffsplit`, since that's the new name of `:Gsdiffsplit`.

## [2.2.3] - 2022-10-29
### Fixed
- Remove a stray echo when generating help for the various Merginal buffers.

## [2.2.2] - 2022-10-05
### Fixed
- Replace `fugitive#repo()` usage with Fugitives standalone functions.

## [2.2.1] - 2021-11-26
### Fixed
- Use `FugitiveShellCommand` instead of `repo.git_command` (which is deprecated by Fugitive)
- Use `Git merge` instead of `Gmerge` (which is deprecated by Fugitive)

## [2.2.0] - 2020-12-06
### Added
- Support separate Meginal buffers on multiple tabs.
- Added merginal_remoteVisible variable to set remote branches to be viewed by default.
- Added a hotkey 'tr' to toggle remote branches in the view.

### Changed
- Calling `Merginal` or `MerginalToggle` when the merginal buffer is open but not in the main mode (branch list by default, or changes if in special Git status) will:
  - Jump to it, if the user is in another window.
  - Change it to the main mode, if the user is in it.

## [2.1.2] - 2020-01-29
### Fixed
- Made merginal commands global, not buffer-local, because Fugutive no longer fires the signals Merginal depended on.
- Changed `fugitive#detect` to `FugitiveDetect`.
- Made `pS` push with `--force-with-lease` instead of just `--force`. Yes, this is a fix. No this is not a breaking change. If this breaks your workflow then your workflow was broken to begin with.
- Made all the mappings `<nowait>`.

## [2.1.1] - 2019-09-06
### Added
- `g:merginal_logCommitCount` to allow limiting amount of commits displayed in history log.

## [2.1.0] - 2017-10-29
### Added
- NERDTree style keymaps for opening files.
- `g:merginal_windowWidth`/`g:merginal_windowSize` to control window size.
- `g:merginal_splitType` to control splitting (vertically/horizontally).

### Changed
- Use committer date instead of author date in `historyLog`.

### Fixed

### Fixed
- Fixed bug when calling `:MerginalToggle` from the merginal buffer.
